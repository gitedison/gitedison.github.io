  <blockquote> <p>"They really work. I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it, but within just 3 meals with the trainers, the 2.5 year old toddler was picking up pieces of meat and even clumps of rice - Chinese rice, no less, which is less sticky than Korean or Japanese rice. Wow! Considering I held chopsticks the wrong way for the first 8 years of my life, I'm impressed."</p></blockquote>

  <blockquote><p>"TJ was able to use his chopsticks the FIRST TIME he tried them! It was sooo cute and adorable. And it actually turned out to be a much easier utensil for TJ to use and self-feed. The fork is still hit or miss at times, depending on how hard or how squishy the food is. But, the chopstick is awesome. TJ can pick up small morsels and big morsels, no matter how oddly shaped or soft they are."</p>

<p>"My 2 sons who were 4 and 2 yrs each when they got their edison chopsticks, was able to handle it immediately. Now my elder son is using the step II. Gradually my children are getting know how to place their fingers in right position and moving forward to the next step. So cool!!! You must let your children try this product."</p>
